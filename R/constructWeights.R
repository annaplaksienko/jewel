#' Construct weights for _jewel_ minimization problem from prior information on vertices degrees.
#'
#' Function takes a numerical vector of vertices degrees and constructs weights with the rule \code{W_ij = 1 / sqrt(d_i * d_j)} and then the whole matrix is normilized by the maximum. 
#
#'
#' @param d either one numerical vector or a list of \code{K} numerical vectors 
#' of length \code{p} with user-provided degrees of vertices for each class. 
#' If there is only one vector, we assume degrees are the same for all \code{K} classes. 
#' In that case parameter \code{K} (number of classes) must be provided.
#' Note that for successful _jewel_ estimation true degrees are not necessary: 
#' for example, user can provide a vector where known hubs have degree 10 
#' and the rest of the vertices have degree 1.
#' @param K number of classes (i.e. datasets, i.e. desired graphs). By default it is length(d).
#' In length(d) = 1, \code{K} must be provided by the user.
#'
#' @return W - a list of \code{K} numeric matrices of the size \code{p} by \code{p}
